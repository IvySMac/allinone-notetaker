# 11 Express.js: Note Taker

## Description
In this assignment, we are now looking into routing and connecting back-end to the front-end. To better see this in action, I've created
the back-end routes to the supplied front-end code. This was a great exercise in seeing first hand how everything is connected under the hood. This was also a great introduction into Heroku and how to set up my future projects on the site. 

## Usage


!['A blue nav bar at the top says 'note taker' up on the left hand side. Under it are three notes that say 'Mow Lawn', 'Grocery Shopping', and 'Pick Up Kids' with a trashcan icon next to each one. In the center there is big text that says 'Note Title' and 'Note Text' under it.' ](/Assets/notetaker.jpg)

To use the note taker, all you need to do is type in the title of the note and any details under it. Then, click the save icon that appears in the top right! You can always go back and click on the notes you've made previously to see what you've written. I have supplied three pre-made notes to show how things work, but you can click the trash can icon to delete them and make your own.
